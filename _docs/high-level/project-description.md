MorphoLens is an agentic morphometry copilot for biomedical researchers working with image-based assays. Instead of manually segmenting structures, placing rulers, and copying numbers into spreadsheets, scientists describe the analysis they want in natural language and let Gemini 3 Pro orchestrate the workflow end-to-end.

MorphoLens reads protocols and papers, understands images, calls segmentation tools, computes geometric or intensity-based metrics, and explains the results in the language of the experiment. The same pattern applies to μCT, histology, fluorescence microscopy, or any protocol-driven image analysis pipeline.

In our current prototype, we focus on μCT-based osteoarthritis scoring in mouse knees as a concrete testbed: MorphoLens recovers literature-defined indices, drives a segmentation model, overlays editable measurements directly on the image in the browser, and reasons about the resulting metrics in the context of prior experiments.

By turning protocol text, images, and tabular data into a single conversational loop, MorphoLens aims to make biomedical image analysis more reproducible, explainable, and accessible—so researchers spend less time babysitting GUIs and more time thinking about biology.
